## **ML Algorithms Implementations**

### **Repository Description:**
A collection of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch, including regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Each project follows a structured approach with detailed explanations, visualizations, and performance evaluations. Implemented in Python using NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas, these projects demonstrate fundamental ML concepts without relying on high-level libraries like scikit-learn.

### **Projects Included:**
- Linear Regression with batch gradient descent (predicting house prices)
- Logistic Regression for binary classification (Iris dataset)
- Minimum Risk Bayes Classifier using Gaussian distributions
- K-Means Clustering for unsupervised learning
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
